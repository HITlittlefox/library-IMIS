		<b>Mark Zuckerberg's Commencement address at Harvard</b><br>
		<br>
		President Faust, Board of Overseers, faculty, alumni, friends, proud parents, members of the ad board, and
		graduates of the greatest university in the world,<br>

		<br>I'm honored to be with you today because, let's face it, you accomplished something I never could. If I get
		through this speech, it'll be the first time I actually finish something at Harvard. Class of 2017,
		congratulations!<br>

		<br>I'm an unlikely speaker, not just because I dropped out, but because we're technically in the same
		generation.
		We walked this yard less than a decade apart, studied the same ideas and slept through the same Ec10 lectures.
		We may have taken different paths to get here, especially if you came all the way from the Quad, but today I
		want to share what I've learned about our generation and the world we're building together.<br>

		<br>But first, the last couple of days have brought back a lot of good memories.<br>

		<br>How many of you remember exactly what you were doing when you got that email telling you that you got into
		Harvard? I was playing Civilization and I ran downstairs, got my dad, and for some reason, his reaction was to
		video me opening the email. That could have been a really sad video. I swear getting into Harvard is still the
		thing my parents are most proud of me for.<br>

		<br>What about your first lecture at Harvard? Mine was Computer Science 121 with the incredible Harry Lewis. I
		was
		late so I threw on a t-shirt and didn't realize until afterwards it was inside out and backwards with my tag
		sticking out the front. I couldn't figure out why no one would talk to me — except one guy, KX Jin, he just went
		with it. We ended up doing our problem sets together, and now he runs a big part of Facebook. And that, Class of
		2017, is why you should be nice to people.<br>

		<br>But my best memory from Harvard was meeting Priscilla. I had just launched this prank website Facemash, and
		the
		ad board wanted to “see me”. Everyone thought I was going to get kicked out. My parents came to help me pack. My
		friends threw me a going away party. As luck would have it, Priscilla was at that party with her friend. We met
		in line for the bathroom in the Pfoho Belltower, and in what must be one of the all time romantic lines, I said:
		“I'm going to get kicked out in three days, so we need to go on a date quickly.”<br>

		<br>Actually, any of you graduating can use that line.<br>

		<br>I didn't end up getting kicked out — I did that to myself. Priscilla and I started dating. And, you know,
		that
		movie made it seem like Facemash was so important to creating Facebook. It wasn't. But without Facemash I
		wouldn't have met Priscilla, and she's the most important person in my life, so you could say it was the most
		important thing I built in my time here.<br>
